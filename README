Get setup with android environemnets and eclipse plugins:

Git:
To get your initial repository set up:
git clone git@github.com:HuntersCreekStudios/GMail-Events-to-Facebook-Events.git
<someLocalDirectory>
A basic day-to-day workflow would look something like:
1) Make some changes, when they are tested and ready to commit
2) 'git pull' to pull down any changes from github and merge them into your local repo
3) 'git status' to see what files you have changed
4) 'git add <file1> <file2> ...' to tell git what you want to commit
5) 'git commit -m "<commit message>" ' to commit the changes to your local repo
6) 'git push' to push your changes up to github
A git tutorial that looks pretty good:

Eclipse:
I don't know if this is the best idea or not, but I will also check in the eclipse project files. So to import this into eclipse you'd just have to File -> Import -> Existing projects into workplace, and then find the directory that you're pulling this down from github.
